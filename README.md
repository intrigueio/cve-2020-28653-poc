# Manage Engine OpManager CVE-2020-28653 Proof of Concept

This proof of concept detects whether a Manage Engine OpManager instance is vulnerable to CVE-2020-28653. Detection is performed by firing off a request containing the serialized payload to the instance. Upon the payload being deserialized, it will cause the instance to invoke a DNS Lookup.

`git clone https://github.com/intrigueio/manageengine-opmanager-exploit-poc`

2. Install the required dependencies by running:
`bundle install`
